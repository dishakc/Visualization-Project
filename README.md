## Project Summary

Our project, ‚ÄúLess Crime, More Dime‚Äù, can be described by words such as Crime, Rent, Los Angeles, Neighborhood, Safety Precautions, Housing, and Real Estate. It is addressed to Residents of Los Angeles or people who are moving to Los Angeles. This web application will be helpful for residents to gauge the rent prices and crime rates around Los Angeles. This is an interesting project since the work has not been undertaken yet and through our application, we will be able to visually represent this correlation. The goal of our project is to allow users to visually understand the correlation between the rent price and crime in Los Angeles and make informed housing decisions.
