A major concern for\n      residents and students living within and around the University of Southern\n      California Parkside Campus is a comparably high crime rate, and as rent\n      paying residents, we are particularly curious about how rent prices in\n      this vicinity are impacted by the crime rate.\n    </p>\n    <!-- <p>\n      <a href=\"https://cli.vuejs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vue-cli documentation</a>.\n    </p> -->\n    <h3>Datasets</h3>\n    <p>\n      To understand the crime patterns in Los Angeles and the relationship\n      between the rent price and the crime rate, we have used two different\n      datasets. \n    </p>\n    <h5><a href=\"https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z/data\" target=\"_blank\">Crime Data</a></h5>\n    <p>\n      This dataset was made available through the City of Los Angeles, via the\n      Office of the Mayor. The data available here was extremely detailed and\n      comprehensive and was meticulously kept up to date by the city, i.e. any\n      and all reported crime between 2010 and 2019 was logged here and included\n      information such as Date and Time of Occurrence, Area, Victim Age/Sex/Race\n      Description, Crime Description, Location, Weapon Used, Crime Code etc.\n      <br /><br />\n\n      For the intents and purposes of this project, we have used the following attributes:\n      <br />\n      <table style=\"width: 100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <th>Attribute</th>\n        <th>Description</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Date Of Occurrence</td>\n        <td>This states the date of occurrence of a reported crime.

There were 141 unique crime\n      codes and therefore 141 crime code descriptions. These descriptions would\n      later be used to assess the seriousness of each crime.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Latitude and Longitude</td>\n        <td>These variables state the\n      latitude and longitude value of each crime reported. They would later be\n      utilized to filter crimes occurring within a specified vicinity of a\n      reported rent listing.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Victim Age, Gender and Race</td>\n        <td>These variables give a\n      brief description of the victim pool.

This dataset included information\n      such as Year, Neighborhood, GEOID, Location, Date, Amount, Tract etc. \n      <br/><br/>  \n      For this project, the following attributes were chosen: \n      <br/>\n      <table style=\"width: 100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <th>Attribute</th>\n        <th>Description</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Amount</td>\n        <td>This value was the median gross rent amount in US Dollars of a rental listing in the rent database. \n          The median gross rent used here is the “measure of\n          the average level of housing affordability in an area”. </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Year</td>\n        <td>This was the year\n      of the rental listing.

Following this, the datasets were iterated over year by year, starting off with 2010 and ending at 2016. For a given datapoint in the Rent Price LA dataset, a filter of ± 0.005 degrees Latitude and Longitude of the given location was applied for the crime dataset. Iterating over each incident in the crime data subset, the frequency of each type of crime for that rent listing was incremented. Once completed, the data frame now provides a comprehensive view of all crimes in the vicinity of each listing as well as their frequencies. \n      This data frame was saved as an intermediate database to be used for collective analysis.\n\n      Since the crime dataset spanned from 2010 to 2019 and the rent dataset spanned \n      to 2016, the visualization consisting of both datasets span from 2010 to 2016.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Brief Overview</h3>\n    <p>\n      We have divided the analysis into three major sections: \n      <table style=\"width: 100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <th>Page</th>\n        <th>Description</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td><router-link to=\"/CrimeDataAnalysis\">Crime Data Analysis</router-link></td>\n        <td>This page has been built to provide the users with a brief overview of the crime and victim patterns by neighborhood. \n      It will allows users to get a high level insights on the crime statistics in Los Angeles. </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td><router-link to=\"/SafetyAndRent\">Safety and Rent correlation</router-link></td>\n        <td>This page allows users to understand the correlation between the safety score and rent over the years from 2010 to 2016 in the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. \n      In general, users can observe that as the safety score increases, the rent increases as well.

Through this application, our hope is that users can get a much more clear picture regarding the crime and rent in Los Angeles. \n      This will definitely be more helpful for international students/new residents looking to move to Los Angeles.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"HelloWorld\",\n  props: {\n    msg: String,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\n<style scoped>\nh3 {\n  margin: 40px 0 0;\n}\nul {\n  list-style-type: none;\n  padding: 0;\n}\nli {\n  display: inline-block;\n  margin: 0 10px;\n}\na {\n  color: #2c3e50;\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\n}\ntable,\nth,\ntd {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n}\nth,\ntd {\n  padding: 15px;\n  text-align: left;\n}\n</style>\n"]}]}
